# MDI-212_TeamProject
After recieving task ans some brainstorming our team decided to create telegramm bot which tansliterates written en/ru text into opposite language.
Our motivation to choose such bot was that everyone of us has been in a situation when you accidentaly print something in Russian instead of English language,
with our bot this problem will be solved. Our bot is deployed at the adress "@TranslitRUENbot" and is currently active.
The ui is quite intuitive, after pressing the start button you either press "help" either enter the text and bot will automatically transliterate it. 
The vital point that should be mentioned is that our bot determines language by the first sign. If first letter is in english text will be transliterated in russian and vica verca. 
Hence, it won't accept anything, starting with special symbol like "!".
The length of text is only limited with telegram message size. Simple as that.
As a result of this project we recieved an opportunity our knowledge which was given to us during the course and recieved some new knowledge about writing bots.
